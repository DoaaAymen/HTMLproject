                    <h2>What is the Future of Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
                
                
                
                    <p>In the following article, we will discuss the future of artificial intelligence. In today’s era, the pace of evolution is faster than ever. We see that progress in technology so rapidly nowadays, from Alexa, SIRI to autonomous vehicles, alpha zero and Sophia. In science fiction movies, we see AI as human-like robots, but in reality, it goes far beyond that which includes programs like alpha zero who has recently beat all humans’ at Chess and other games.</p>
                
                
                    <p>AI is an emerging field; today, it is known as weak AI (Due to limitations). But the future of artificial intelligence is about building strong AI. Right now, AI can beat humans in some specific tasks only, but in the future, it is expected of AI to beat a human in all cognitive tasks. Surely it has its consequences which would be positive as well as negative.</p>
